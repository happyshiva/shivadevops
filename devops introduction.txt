introduction to DEVOPS
DEVOPS is a process 
DEVOPS is a method

lifecycle of devops is 
1.plan 2.code 3.build 4.test 5.release 6.deploy 7.operate 8.monitor

note:devops means implementing automation in each and every stage

we have some stages in devops are 
1.version control:in this we are maintaining different versions of code like github
2.continupus integration:it is a software develoment process,developers regularly merge their code to the central repo.in this code changes has been done and code build and test afre happen and code runs also happen.
finally code review,code testing,testing,integration,compile are happen
3.continuous delivery:deployment the build app to test servers 
code changes automatically done and tested 
ready for release for to production
4.continuous delivery:deployment the test app on the production server for release 

devops allow one team to maintain lifecycle of an application like testing,operations,develoment,deployment
devops main objective is to shorten the system's development life cycle
devops is a software approach to get a reliable faster and efficient software
